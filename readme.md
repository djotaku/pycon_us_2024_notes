# Pycon US 2024 Notes

Since the talks are eventually posted to Youtube, I try to capture stuff that stands out to me.

This year I also have "Interesting Talks I Did not Attend" - this is a list of talks I couldn't go to because they were at the same time as another talk I attended. It's a tickler for me to remember to watch the talks when the videos are posted to YT.
