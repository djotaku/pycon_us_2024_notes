Keynote: Jay Miller

Founder of Black Python Devs

First interaction with Python community (but really stack overflow) was "your code isn't pythonic"

Second interaction was "your project is so cool, tell me more about it"

Representation very important to see themself in leadership, keynote speaker, etc 

Speaker happy to say that that they are not the first black python keynote speaker - awesome to be the fifth instead of first for once

In 2022 only counted 12 attendees, speakers, conf expo hall other black participants

Ultimately, their goal was to make a A something that would be a Wakanda for Python.
