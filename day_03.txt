keynote: Kate Chapman

equitable opportunities in tech

Officially talk title - Ingredients for Collaboration in Sociotechnical ...(missed a word)

We should all have equitable opportunities. Eg not everyone has internet access or stable internet access

Sometimes when people say a problem is solved, it's solved for them, but not for everyone. 

great exmaples with openstreetmap and how it helped with earthquake in Haiti

what if the mapping happened ahead of time? Speaker started a (the?) OSM community in Jakarta

for a lot of speaker's examples timing is very important to the collaboration

Open Supply Hub is new project t oepxlore global supply chain data

============================

PSF - meet our security engineers

Mostly an introduction to the two sec engineers. But also check the blog and the QR codes at the end of the talk.

===========================

1100 - PyQt and PySide Open Space

Pyside more pythonic bindings than PyQT

Pyside has an ability to create truly compiled binaries with nuitka

There was a Qt company hack-a-thon that will make the Qt Quick look native

Look for the qt designer from pyside6 that has some extra stuff and their own pyide6 pyuic

1300 - AI, IP, and Your Code: What Developers Need to Know

we usually think more about licenses in programming vs copyrights and trademarks

because of hte monkey photography case - only humans can hold copyright and so AI cannot hold copyright

training data - where did it come from? Even open source LLM usually is black box when it comes to the training data

while using copyrighted data might not be copright infringement on its own - regurgitation is must more a direct copyright infringement


============================

1345 - Connecting Old to New with CircuitPython: Retrocomputer input devices on modern PCs

speaker funded by Adafruit

full version of each roject with complete source code on learn.adafruit.com and github (see links at end of slide deck)

used KB2040 and QTPy RP2040

most keyboards are wired as a matrix

part of what helps this work is that old stuff in the 80s used to come with schematics when you bought it. So you don't have to guess or fuzz to figure out how it works.

code for commodore keyboard is just 26 lines of code (not counting comments)


========================

1430 - Unlocking the Parallel Universe: Subinterpreters and Free-Threading in Python 3.13

funny talk - def worth watching again

pre-req slide funny

because of overhead (pickling, assigning tasks) you can't just divide the time to do something and say that's the time it takes to execute in parallel

see the table of parallel execution in Python - explains a lot of the small details

(note to self review parallel vs concurrency, etc)

threads WAY slower than sub interpreters for calculating digits of pi (because of the threads overhead) - see that slide

sub inter is like multiproc wiht less overhead and shared memory

free threading - python 3.13b1 you can "disable" the GIL

in py3.13 single-threaded code is faster ANYWAY

GIL exists for thread safety <- super important point (according to speaker)

there's a new ABi so special wheels and a special build of CPython needed

full removal of GIL and compat with C libraries will take a long time (according to speaker). Code that is full Python can already work well without the GIL (to use these features)

up to now it was a toy program - calculating pi digits. But this has implications with running Gunicorn.

1515 - keynote: Sumana Harihareswara

Untold stories from many years caring through infrastructure

speaker was maintainer of pip for a while

this talk is great. Shows, at least partly, that project management can be as useful as coding for FLOSS projects. This is great - usually folks say if you can't code - contribute to documentation. But here's another skill you can bring to a project.
