- djangogirls group was introduction to python for one of the panelists
- discussion about how keeping the community together during COVID was hard
- discussion about how money can be key in keeping community going

keynote: Simon Willison

Most of the AI companies are very secretive about their training data sources. Only Meta has been open about the source.

just because a tool is flawed doesn't mean it's not useful!

Usually an "open source" model is not. There are lots of little clauses that restrict the way it can be used.

Function calling tools in a loop. I'd heard this before, but it bears repeating - you have to tell the LLM to do things like use calculators in order to get them closer to intelligence instead of just predictively giving the next word

the above is easy to do in Python according to speaker. 

Prompt injection - the security issue of LLMs. According to speaker - we currently don't know how to keep this from happening. (Similar to SQL injection in that you are combining data and instructions in the same data stream"

to help prevent - never mix untrusted text with access to tools

uses ML/AI as an enable for side projects

"AI spoken word counter" - incredible live demo during conference

Speaker once again reiterates that part of what AI/ML helps with is being able to knock out "side quests" quickly and get him to try out projects they might otherwise not do because it would take too long to learn all the libraries, etc.

Structured Data Extraction - using AI/ML as part of journalism. Example - taking unstructured data (like police reports or PSF board reports) and putting it into a form that can be used by computers - eg put into a database.

The challenge of the above is that while it's faster than manual generation, the human still needs to do some checking of the data.

speaker suggests not calling it Generative AI, but Transformative AI

============

1030 - Friends don't let friends package alone

Became a maintainer by mistake - meaning that the maintainer of the package was leaving, but the speaker didn't want the package to die.

Turns out it needed modernization - it didn't have CI/CD or updated docs (Having let my docs fall out of date - I can relate!!)

Speaker didn't have expertise in packaging so they turned to experts

Paralized by choice in packaging (both a great and a terrible thing about the current python situation)

Wanted to be able to maintain a package without becoming a packing expert

I (not the speaker) will say this is where some other languages - Go, Rust - are doing things better. Maybe it's because those are compiled and that makes things easier in the end?

Based on people the speaker talks to while educating (scientist) they want a default way to do this instead of a million ways to do it. 

www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide

One of the things they prioritized for their packaging guide was to have an opnionated tutorial

Wanted to make sure their guide was beginner-friendly so they started with expert feedback, but then had a community review to make sure it was still beginner friendly. Also key - makig it a living guidebook, not a blog post. They have had 51 contributors. They will sprint Monday at Pycon.

Comparison of end-to-end tools (like Hatch) and individual tools (python -m build, twine upload, etc)

===========

1115 - Making Python Safer than Ever

See slide on top 10 risks with OSS

CPython artifacts signed and stored on sigstore

https://www.python.org/downloads/sigstore

You can also use it in a GH action (sigstore) - see slide and also read up based on the URL on the slide

PSF can create CVEs now (they are a CNA) for CPython and Pip

They have increased the speed of dealing with vulns and malware reported to PyPi

They had a security audit of PyPi funded with OTF (there was a pybites or talk python episode about this - try searching online ot add to notes)


===========

1200 - Having fun with pydantic and pattern matching

when using match case, the order of the cases is significant!

exception handling works this way too

for their talk, key to the stream of data is that it's a never-ending stream. Meaning you don't know when it ends.

handling code gets really crazy with nested ifs very quickly

use of Literal in the Pydantic model is awesome because it can restrict what can go there instead of just saying it's a stringm <- wow!!

research more about TypeAdaptor from Pydantic 2.0

look up functools singledispatch




============

1330 - How Python Harnesses Rust through PyO3

(skipped watch later)

============

Security open space

- for attestation for PyPi look for Trusted Publisher documentation - Github can do this with an action

- github has a vulnerability database advisaries - that's what makes dependabot alerts

- you can use the GH vulns - and can request a CVE via Github. They have an open source CVE naming service

- CVSS score calculator

- you should create a Security.md that explains how you handle security (node.js is a great template)

- Python and Github are working together ot get something similar to Go's Capslock Analyzer

- in your projects declare your intent of how much you want to deal with security. So people know whether to depend on your stuff


===========

1430 - Eternal sunshine of the spotless development environment

(missed due to the security open space watch later)

1515 - Python and SQL: Better Together, Powered by DuckDB

DuckDB is different than the usual SQL databaes. See the slide with the graph with SQLite, PostreSQL, and ClickHouse

DuckDB's dialect is more like python than SQL

if you're doing pandas (DuckDB seems to be targeted towards scientists/datascientists) you can read/write form/to dataframes

It's compatible with PostgreSQL

=========

1615 - Talks: Creative Coding with py5, the Python version of Processing

(interesting demo)

==========

1700 - Talks: Demystifying AsyncIO: Building Your Own Event Loop in Python

(need to rewatch to get all the details into my head)

==========

1745 - Lightning Talks

will add notes later - took notes on phone
