Most of the AI companies are very secretive about their training data sources. Only Meta has been open about the source.

just because a tool is flawed doesn't mean it's not useful!

Usually an "open source" model is not. There are lots of little clauses that restrict the way it can be used.

Function calling tools in a loop. I'd heard this before, but it bears repeating - you have to tell the LLM to do things like use calculators in order to get them closer to intelligence instead of just predictively giving the next word

the above is easy to do in Python according to speaker. 

Prompt injection - the security issue of LLMs.
